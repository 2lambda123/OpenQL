Where to go from here
=====================

This manual is not really complete yet, but hopefully the most important things
have been treated, and you can figure out the rest from the much more complete
:ref:`reference <ref_python>`. If not, you may try to read through some of the
:ref:`older pages <program>`. These have not yet been updated for version 0.9,
but may still provide useful background information.
