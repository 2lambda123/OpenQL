Doxygen documentation
=====================

Documentation for the C++ source code is `generated by Doxygen <../doxy/index.html>`_.
Properly documenting everything with docstrings is unfortunately still an ongoing process,
but at the very least all the functions and classes should be there, as automatically documented by Doxygen.
