Supported global options
========================

This section lists all the global options currently supported by OpenQL.

.. note::
   Most of these options exist only for backward compatibility, having been
   superseded by pass options. They will be used only when the pass list is
   automatically generated to mimic legacy behavior, or when compatibility
   mode is enabled in the compiler configuration file.
