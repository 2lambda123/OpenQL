OpenQL is a C++ framework for high-level quantum programming. The framework provide 
a compiler for compiling and optimizing quantum code.
The compiler produce the intermediate quantum assembly language and the compiled micro-code 
for different ptarget platforms. While the microcode is platform-specific, the quantum assembly 
code (qasm) is hardware-agnostic and can be simulated on the QX simulator.
